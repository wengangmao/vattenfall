### Plan/action for Week 40
<span style = "font-weight: 400; font-size: 25px; color: red">
  1. Continue to preprocessing data <br />
  2. convert into Tensorflow dataset format for time series analysis <br />
  3. Looking for possiblies to apply other modelling techniques <br />
</span>



### General update of research activities

* Preliminary investigation of the data from Berhalu@Vattenfall
* Very correlated and high frequency data for one scenario
* Promising to get the model for such prediction
